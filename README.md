# CreateDatabase

Hello everyone!

This is the simple project created only by functions. 
It takes three text files I made from polish names, surnames and cities. 
Program asks for amount of records we want and create the simple database. 
Then ask for the name of the file to save. 

If you have any comment, please let me know. I'm still learning.
Thank you in advance,
              Nikole
